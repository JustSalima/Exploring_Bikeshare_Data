### Exploring Bikeshare Data

#### Description
This is the final project for Introduction to Python and is part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree. This project uses Python and Pandas to explore bikeshare data for Chicago, New York and Washington, DC. Descriptive statistical data is calculated for:
- Popular times of travelÂ 
- Popular stations and trip
- Trip duration

Data is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.
